Problem Id: TSL-1.0
Problem Title: Feedback Collection And Management
Description:
As much important is a service provided by a company so much important is to measure the quality of service. One such way is to gather and manage feedback.
Design a page which manages a food service feedback. The page contains customer id, a short description of the service followed by a rating and text feedback.
Rating happens on a scale of 1 to 5. Text feedback is optional. On submit, the feedback gets logged into a database. There is a vendor dashboard where all the feedback can be monitored.
There is also a service available to the user where user can see all the feedback given by far.
